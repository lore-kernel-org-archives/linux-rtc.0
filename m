If that is the case, where are these tools?

Sorry, I don't think userspace has the information to do a good job.
The idea of setting the RTC to measure the offset is a hack - it's
something that is going to have to be measured each and every time
that the RTC is set, and would need to be done by a real-time process
to ensure that other system noise does not affect it.

As has already been said, Jason's suggestion is to export this
information to userspace so that hwclock can be fixed in a similar
way.  hwclock isn't too relevant to the NTP question though, because
it isn't used while ntpd is running.

I suspect that won't happen, because there won't be enough interest
in fixing it.  As I've said, this issue had come up years ago, and
the same suggestions were made at that time.  Here we are today,
still without a userspace tool to do it.  What's different this
time around?

Are you going to put the effort in yourself to solve this problem,
or are you going to leave it to some ghostly apperition to do,
resulting in yet another vapourware tool that never actually
materialises?

I'll repeat that I have no interest in creating such a tool as I
already have a working in-kernel solution that doesn't need me to
create any userspace tooling, and I don't care that it isn't in
mainline.
