Since this is kerneldoc, you need an empty line after "sequence." above.

You should also add a comment that this function depends on local
interrupts being disabled when called (for the wait_not_busy handling); 
and make sure you follow that in subsequent patches.

dev is never used in this function.

This note really doesn't make much sense anymore, and should have been
updated as part of the previous patch.

Use struct omap_rtc here as before.

What is all this, and why is it here?

Surely fiddling with this register after you've set the alarm to trigger
isn't the right thing to do.
