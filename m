There is no api to change the epoch of an RTC because it is difficult to
do in a race free way. This has to be worked on.

Anyway, you don't really care for now as it goes up to 2093 and
hopefully, you will never have a product with a different epoch.

The other issue being that you don't have any way to know whether the
base is correct or not until the date is set.

It would be a change that is easy enough to do in a backward compatible
way so that is probably fine.
