I guess I should have updated the Kconfig text when I removed the LPC24xx bits.

I'll put something this in the next version:
tristate "NXP LPC178x/18xx/43xx RTC"
...
help
  This enables support for the NXP RTC found which can be found on
  LPC178x/18xx/43xx devices.

When the device doesn't have battery the CTIME registers contains an
invalid value. So if you don't set them to something valid you will
get a warning each time you try to read the RTC. To "fix" that problem
I set the time at epoch which make the CTIME registers to contain a
valid value. Since the value is already useless I think setting it to
epoch is an improvement in this case.

I guess it deserves a comment in the driver.

> Why not trickle an error up to the rtc class driver?

Because the rtc class will never correct the CTIME register values and
will complain each time lpc24xx_rtc_read_time() is called. Of course
if a user set the time from user space the register value is also
corrected.

Thanks for taking the time to look at the patch again.
