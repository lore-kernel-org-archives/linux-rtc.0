Yeah, I understood the change, it can go in as soon as you send the
patch.

You also must not compare pointers that way. You can use
of_device_is_compatible().

I'm not fond of the backward compatibility exactly for that kind of
issue. The proper way to handle it is to have tow different compatible
strings because obviously, the BB and AD variants are not compatible.
