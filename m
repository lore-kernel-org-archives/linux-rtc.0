[TL;DR]

IMHO, we can switch this patch to epoch.ns time; but the momentum on the
tools will end up with us internally patching it back to RTC format at 
least until
we can get our act together ... I have accepted that risk, we always like to
see all changes upstream though. Would an additional config parameter
appease the situation?

Yes, I should have been clearer about that, in fact my comments in 0/4 
were _backwards_
when I reread them ;-/. One of the issues is the somewhat helpful suspend
millisecond duration requires a persistent clock, which is _not_ 
available on all
hardware. Printing the time on entry and exit from suspend and resume is 
always
possible because we are staying away from that lower level issue.

I should probably roll the details of 0/4 comments into 1/4, the intro 
has not served
its purpose.

It should also be made clearer that these single messages serve _two_ 
purposes,
the primary one is power analysis; the secondary one is log synchronization.

The timestamps are useful for the 'second' purpose of these patches when
dmesg time is BOOTTIME or MONOTONIC, and can be turned off if REALTIME
is selected. Having rtc_show_time a single point for switching this no 
doubt helps,
not hinders, that dmesg issue.

The inflection points would still serve a purpose, still need
suspend/resume/hibernate/restore. The reboot messages are _only_ useful to
us with their timestamps, as I checked and the only tools that use those are
for log synchronization. We may be able to do away with them on REALTIME
dmesg'ing; but the standardization of the message as a marker would have a
legacy purpose (!)

NB: We have a similar configuration for the user space logger, which can be
configured to report in MONOTONIC time. We have yet to have a vendor
use the feature, opting for REALTIME logging for user space activities.
Our klogd (which runs at background priority and is batched) manages a
histogram relationship between MONOTONIC and REALTIME helped by these
prints and incorporates the REALTIME dmesg logs merged into our user
space logging database.
