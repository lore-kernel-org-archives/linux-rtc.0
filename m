Right, so it'll be correct for a different set of RTCs and wrong
for others.  So, forget current versions of hwclock, none of them
know how to correctly set the time on all RTCs.  It fundamentally
lacks the information required, because there's no way for it to
know that information at present.

That could work, but you're looking at making every hwclock based
write take maybe at least two seconds, unless you cache that
information somewhere.  If you cache that, then you end up with a
problem when someone (like I do) copies the rootfs between different
platforms.  Sometimes I copy SD cards.

Sometimes I even NFS boot the same export on different platforms
(but obviously not at the same time.)

It's not just about running hwclock every 11 minutes.  It's about
running hwclock when NTP sync'd.  If the local clock is not sync'd
you don't want to be running hwclock, especially if you've trimmed
the RTC.  So merely throwing hwclock -uw into a cron job really
doesn't solve it.

A way around that would be to install adjtimex, so that the kernel's
NTP flags can be read out.  However, that comes with its own set of
problems.

On Debian, installing adjtimex will disrupt the timekeeping because
of the post-install scripts debian runs.  It seems Debian assumes
that if you install something, it has the right to modify the system
timekeeping parameters immediately, screwing up ntpd in the process,
if it's running.  The thought that you're installing adjtimex because
you want to _inspect_ the kernel ntp parameters is not one that
Debian folk appear to have considered as being a reason for installing
the package.

Do not go there.  Having run systems with no local RTC, I can tell you
that they're a right pain if system time is not properly set before
userspace starts.  For example, you sometimes can't get a "ps" listing
because a procfs file contains a "btime" of zero, and it complains
and errors out on that.  Other problems have been NFS XIDs which end
up always starting from the same value, so the NFS server thinks they
are being replayed by the client (despite it being an entirely different
kernel being run.)  That still exists if you reboot quickly enough.

So no, removing hctosys would be a big mistake.

systohc is more questionable, and always has been.  The "push it out
to userspace" approach has been tried in the past, yet we seem to
have it back in the kernel.  IIRC, it was originally decided that
rtclib would not support it, and that it was going to be done in
userspace.

However, the userspace part never appeared, and instead rtclib
eventually gained support for it, because it's what people want to
see.

I'm not yet convinced by the "lets push it all into userspace" argument
because that's vapourware - and we've been there before.  It's "nice"
to state but if no one steps up and does it, it's of no benefit and
just results in people carrying local hacks (eg in vendor kernels), or
working around those who state it.

I also don't particularly like the concept of trying to measure the
RTC's time-set offset.  My userspace programs that measure the RTC
offset show that to get to millisecond resolution, it isn't trivial
because of system timing "noise" - you need to calibrate the reading
side first so you can get an estimation of when the RTC second flips.
You'd then need to set the RTC time, and then re-measure when the RTC
second flips, wait for the appropriate system time and then write the
RTC.  You're look at between 2 and 4 seconds for that, and a window
where a perfectly good RTC could be set to an offset time.
