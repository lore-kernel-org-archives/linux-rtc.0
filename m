Yes, will change that.

Yes this is not needed.

Ex: We programmed at Sec = 2 and we expect ALARM2 to fire at sec = 3.

In the event of Roll over before setting the
OMAP_RTC_INTERRUPTS_IT_ALARM2 bit in the OMAP_RTC_INTERRUPTS_REG will we
not miss the ALARM2 event? Then poweroff would fail right?

Hence the attempt to retry the next second. This sequence would begin
right at the beginning of a new second and we expect the full sequence
to get over without having to retry again.

Hope i am clear.
