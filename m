Okay then. Any suggestion to do otherwise ?
Alexandre suggested to pass the GPBR register number through a module
parameter, and retrieve the GPBR syscon by searching for a gpbr node
(or atmel,at91sam9260-gpbr compatible node) in the device tree.

I'm not a big fan of this solution, as it implies passing driver
specific config to the global cmdline (and we'll have to handle the
9263 case where 2 RTT blocks are availables).

Best Regards,

Boris
