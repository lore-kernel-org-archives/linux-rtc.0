The 0.5s hardcoding depends on the version of hwclock you use (the
busybox one doesn't do it anymore).

I thought it was handling it better than that and I was indeed
incorrect.

What about setting the time on the RTC once, then using UIE to get the
offset between the set time and the real time then set the time on the
RTC again after accounting for the offset. That would work nicely for
most RTCs.

But nothing prevents you from using hwclock every 11 minutes from
userspace. I really don't think this should be done from the kernel.

Even better, from userspace you can actually chose the time interval you
want. To me, this all seems to be policy encoded in the kernel.

I really don't think you currently need help from the kernel to do any
of it (apart from adjusting the oscillator obviously). Nothing currently
prevents you to keep a set_offset_nsec in userspace so you can actually
set the time as close as possible to the current time.

I didn't have time to draft a PoC and that is why I didn't reply on the
patch yet.

What I think is needed is a better tool, maybe a daemon, that would
handle both keeping tabs on the needed offset and handle the oscillator
trimming as it may need to get back and forth between two close values.

I still think we need to drop the SYSTOHC and HCTOSYS stuff. I agree it
can't happen overnight as some people are currently relying on it and
they need to migrate.

But having users wondering whether they should keep hwclock or use
SYSTOHC/HCTOSYS is fucked up as SYSTOHC probably doesn't do what they
want if they don't use NTP (and so they still need to be able to set
time from userspace).
