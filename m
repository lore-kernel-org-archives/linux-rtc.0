I made the try, and Russell was right, this breaks the pxa architecture. The
relevant extract of kernel message is in [1].

The consequences with your patches :
 - pxa27x_init()
   - platform_add_devices()
     - the pxa_device_rtc fails (as resource is duplicated)
     - all the devices are unregistered (rollback)
And pxa27x fails.

Now I'm pondering about the right approach :
 - either remove sa1100_device_rtc from pxas
 - or remove pxa_device_rtc
 - or both
 - or something else

Let me think a bit about it.
