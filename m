Hi Rob,

I searched in kernel documents and found a similar usage in
"ti,palmas-pwrbutton.txt"
"- ti,palmas-long-press-seconds: Duration in seconds which the power
  button should be kept pressed for Palmas to power off automatically."

Could I just wrote it like this?
mediatek,long-press-seconds = <0>;

And for the wakeup source part, how about Dmitry's suggestion? 
The whole device node would be:

mt6397keys: mt6397keys {
	compatible = "mediatek,mt6397-keys";
	mediatek,long-press-mode = <1>;
	mediatek,long-press-seconds = <0>;
	
	power@0 {
		linux,code = <116>;
		wakeup-source;
	};

	home@0 {
		linux,code = <114>;
	};
};

Thank you.
