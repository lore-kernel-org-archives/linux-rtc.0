A simple way to be sure would be to read RTD_RTCSEC first, then the
other registers and check RTD_RTCSEC didn't change. This will ensure the
other registers have not be updated in the meantime (unless it takes
one minute but I doubt this is the case). if RTD_RTCSEC changed, then
you can start over.

Completely untested:

for (y = data->base_year; (day - (365 + is_leap_year(y))) > 0; y++)
	day -= (365 + is_leap_year(y));

for (m = 0; (day - rtc_month_days(m, y)) > 0; m++)
	day -= rtc_month_days(m, y);

They are (were) used only when the rtc character device (/dev/rtcx) is
opened/released but the cdev interface is one of many interfaces to the
RTC sod it doesn't make sense to do something only in that case
(especially requesting IRQs).

To solve your concern, this is what I'm going to apply after fixing the
two remaining uses of .release:
