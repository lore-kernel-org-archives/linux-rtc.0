Remove all references to AT91CAP9 SoC which has been removed.
Rework the help message to remove any specific references to AT91SAM9 SoCs.

+	  Some AT91SAM9 SoCs provide an RTT (Real Time Timer) block which
+	  can be used as an RTC thanks to the backup power supply (e.g. a
+	  small coin cell battery) which keeps this block and the GPBR
+	  (General Purpose Backup Registers) block powered when the device
+	  is shutdown.
+	  Some AT91SAM9 SoCs provide a real RTC block, on those ones you'd
+	  probably want to use the real RTC block instead of the RTT as an
+	  RTT driver.
