This is what I initially submitted here.
But Arnd wanted to see a smaller patch which only fixes gemini timer 
issue (t.i. shed clock being 100Hz instead of 25MHz).
Also I've submitted 4.1 support yesterday, but patches didn't change 
much comparing to 3.18
I would love to see all those patches/drivers in mainline - tell me 
where do I submit all that :)

Roman
