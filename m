I see. It would make sense to merge the concepts a bit since the prints 
are at the same locations.

Optimization idea: rtc_show_time() in my patch series should be able to 
support varargs, never be _disabled_ (CONFIG_RTC_SHOW_TIME_NONE idea is 
dropped) and the function would be a drop-in replacement for pr_info, 
but add the specified timestamp before the newline. Change it's name to 
pr_info_show_time() instead to reflect this adjustment.

I would also prefer that the base messages in patch/980217 be "PM: 
suspend entry" and "PM: suspend exit", only because I believe 1.6billion 
Linux devices would not need to be retooled, and besides these messages 
are shorter/sweeter.

Anyone disagree with some more over-engineering (pr_info_show_time() and 
varargs)
