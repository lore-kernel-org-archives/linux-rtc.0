Can we please fix the tools and not introduce that horror in the kernel?

Printing ktime_get_real_seconds() gives you the wall time. I was merily
explaining that this is the same as reading CLOCK_REALTIME from userspace.

Just for the record: You cannot use that stuff deep in the suspend/resume
code because timekeeping is suspended there as well and that call to
getnstimeofday() is going to trigger a WARNON() when called after
timekeeping was suspended. So please be more precise about the limitations
of this.

There was some discussion about making the clock source for dmesg time
stamps selectable, so you can use MONOTONIC, REALTIME, BOOTTIME. The
patches looked sensible, but there was some showstopper vs. the user space
dmesg utility. See:

  http://lkml.kernel.org/r/1456250040-22351-1-git-send-email-prarit@redhat.com

I rather see that resolved and these patches merged than having yet another
half baken special purpose debug band aid. Maybe Prarit can shed some light
on the state of this.

Thanks,
