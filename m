oops, good catch.

Again, oops, changed rtc_time_to_tm to rtc_time64_to_tm as requested, 
did not change other pieces.

Legacy (these prints have been in Android tree since 2013) for all our 
battery and power analysis tools are keyed off RTC format. There is some 
momentum, default should be epoch seconds/nanoseconds as that is a good 
example; and another option can select RTC (the option can be an 
internal patch to alter the format ... ick)

This is part of triage and post-analysis, there is no user space call 
that can be made after the fact to correlate MONOTONIC time with 
REALTIME. The historgram for the relationship between the two time 
formats is built up in user space based on batched analysis of the 
kernel logs. Although the values slip because of ntp and other sources, 
suspend/resume/hibernate/restore and shutdown are definitive points of 
interest for analysis. The analysis is performed on klogd data which has 
a longer logging span than the internal buffer.

tracepoints are disabled on field devices. As is debugfs. This is not 
logging/debugging, but field battery and power analysis. Some of the 
data shows up in the Battery Settings screen on the devices. We also 
_benefit_ from this information when correlating kernel logs with user 
space logs during triage.
