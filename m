I ... don't like that much, especially when you consider both rtc might be
modules for example. I rather like that patch in pxa as they are.

I'm rather in a mood for a more aggressive approach :

 - you fire an incremental patch to patch the 10 defconfigs on PXA architecture
   (pxa27x and pxa3xx)
 - in this patch, you replace 's/CONFIG_RTC_DRV_SA1100/CONFIG_RTC_DRV_PXA/'
 - you send this patch to the maintainers and me
 - you explain in the commit message that from a userland perspective, nothing
   changes, except that the RTC IP will change, and any dependency on a
   bootloader fidling with RTC should be considered as a source of regression.
   Moreover the first reboot will have the wrong date, until it is set.

After that, if no board maintainer complains, or doesn't answer (and therefore
doesn't care), and you have my blessing to make the switch. If one complains and
demonstrates why this change might break his board, we'll see.

Cheers.
