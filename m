I think the rationale here is that the rtc device is not the wakeup
device but the underlying one is hence why it is in
/sys/class/rtc/rtc0/device/power and not in /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/power/.

For now, parsing this property is left to the individual drivers.
You'll have to implement it for the tps65910 and so you can get it from
the parent node if necessary.
