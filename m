Subject: [PATCH v1 00/16] Add support to MT6323 RTC and its power device

Hi,

The series keeps to extend the capability of BPI-R2 board with MT7623 and
the result can as well bring benefits into the other MediaTek PMICs such
as MT6397 or SoCs.

The series sent across mfd, rtc, pm, dt-binding sub-system is for hoping
to let people have a simple cross-reference to know the exact dependency
and why those patches are being split in that way between each one.

Patch 1-3: Add dt-binding to the related devices newly or already
	   supported.
Patch 4-5: Extend driver with the functionality of MT6323 RTC device.
Patch 6-9 and 12-13: Add a few of trivial fixups, cleanups and
	  improvements.
Patch 10-11: It's a preparation for Patch 14 adding a new driver.
Patch 14: Add a new driver for a power-off driver.
Patch 15-16: Update MAINTAINERS with these new files being added.

	Sean
