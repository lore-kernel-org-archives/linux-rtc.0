Subject: [PATCH v4 2/4] rtc: OMAP: Add support for rtc-only mode

Prepare rtc driver for rtc-only with DDR in self-refresh mode.
omap_rtc_power_off now should cater to two features:

1) RTC plus DDR in self-refresh is power a saving mode where in the
entire system including the different voltage rails from PMIC are
shutdown except the ones feeding on to RTC and DDR. DDR is kept in
self-refresh hence the contents are preserved. RTC ALARM2 is connected
to PMIC_EN line once we the ALARM2 is triggered we enter the mode with
DDR in self-refresh and RTC Ticking. After a predetermined time an RTC
ALARM1 triggers waking up the system[1]. The control goes to bootloader.
The bootloader then checks RTC scratchpad registers to confirm it was an
rtc_only wakeup and follows a different path, configure bare minimal
clocks for ddr and then jumps to the resume address in another RTC
scratchpad registers and transfers the control to Kernel. Kernel then
restores the saved context. omap_rtc_power_off_program does the ALARM2
programming part.

     [1] http://www.ti.com/lit/ug/spruhl7h/spruhl7h.pdf Page 2884

2) Power-off: This is usual poweroff mode. omap_rtc_power_off calls the
above omap_rtc_power_off_program function and in addition to that
programs the OMAP_RTC_PMIC_REG for any external wake ups for PMIC like
the pushbutton and shuts off the PMIC.

Hence the split in omap_rtc_power_off.
