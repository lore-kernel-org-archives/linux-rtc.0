It's the standard way to turn a regular integer division into one which
rounds-to-closest - I consider it to be one of the basics which every
programmer should know, and therefore should be obvious.

Integer division in the form of:

	r = (a + b / 2) / b

should be part of the programmers basic knowledge set.
