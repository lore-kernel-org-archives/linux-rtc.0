And you will get an interrupt if the event occurs before the i2c burst
starts. Once the i2cburst does start, you are committing to the new time.

if the previous alarm does expire before the new alarm is programmed
(before the burst is started), you will get an event - why does this
patch change this? the case you are concerned seem to be the case where
the time you program is in the past at the point when alarm interrupt is
enabled.

Lets see the current behavior(before this patch): time currently
requested is in the past, you are dead anyways. this can happen since
the decision of programming the time is done in userspace(example with
rtcwake) and there are latencies as part of suspend path (file sync)
that can cause the possible cases - consider "rtcwake -s 1" - and for
the moment, lets assume that rtc event is the only wakeup event possible
for the system (to address your point).

a) If the rtcwake progams time before initiating suspend state and prior
to suspend_no_irq is hit event triggers, irq is handled by rtc driver,
and we proceed on to suspend state - but no further irqs can be expected
"dead state"
b) predicted time occurs before suspend_no_irq level is reached, but
before the system actually enters suspend -> event occurs with irq
disabled and depending on smartness of platform code, it can detect that
the wakeup event occurred prior to attempting suspend (hence "dead state")
c) If rtcwake's set_alarm invocation is slowed due to filesystem or
other load activities, the time requested to wakeup is already in the
past, you are in deadstate as the wakeup event has already occurred
prior to entering suspend path.

Note: even with android alarm driver(at least the last time i looked at
it a few years ago), this situation is probably escaping (a), but (b)
and (c) is still real and has to be properly anticipated.

My patch does nothing different to this behavior - only point changed is
*if the previous event does not take place prior to new request being
initiated, then we have to assume that the new time is what we wanted
wakeup event for*. That I strongly believe is necessary.

Point being - using a time for wake attempted to be predicted ahead of
time of suspend path is a a bunch of empirical data analysis - you can
have a dead system today and this code does not change that behavior - I
doubt you can ever get a clean fix without a constant latency.

Ummm.... why is that any different? In effect, you are just disabling
the compare logic inside the RTC differently and that said, I am not
entirely sure if I want to test the MCP794xx RTL designer's logic with
invalid dates being programmed for month/date etc.. ;)

True - had noticed that as well. have'nt had time to optimize the path yet.

Yep - was planning on fixing 10 to 9 - But that is not related to this
patch anyways. I will do that follow on patch next time I get a break :)

yet another patch that I need to do is to check for OSCRUN before
attempting to program time or alarm -> no point in setting time is
oscillator is non-functional even after waiting for oscillator
stabilization time after ST bit is set.. again.. need to do that
separate from this patch.
