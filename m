And arch/arm/configs/jornada720_defconfig I counted wrongly as it's sa1100.
So I agree with your list of last 6 defconfigs.

For boards which were only using rtc-pxa.c (as mioa701 for example), they relied
on the fact that rtc0 == pxa_rtc. Their time is stored in PXA IP. Therefore,
each of their hwclock will end up on sa1100-rtc instead of pxa-rtc.

So for these boards, ie. for all boards where only rtc-pxa.c was used, the IP
addressed changes from a casual userspace perspective.

Let's talk about how a double boot windows + linux box works.
The bootloader ensures that :
 - sa1100-rtc holds the number of seconds since the OS start (think jiffies)
 - pxa-rtc holds the wall clock time

Upon each reboot, sa1100-rtc is checked to see how much time has passed. If an
"oustanding number" is detected, for example 10 years, the firmware resets the
data partition.

Now think what will happen when this change will be commited, upon the first
reboot after the linux kernel has change sa1100-rtc time.

Yes, right, unless the bootloader logic is ... over-engineered.

All of this to say maintainers should be forwarned at least. After that, up to
them to react.

Cheers.
