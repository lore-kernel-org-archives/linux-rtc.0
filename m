tglx,

There were two outstanding issues with my patchset.  The first, as you mention
above, is the issue with tooling.  I will handle the chicken-and-egg issue with
the kernel modification and tooling.  I will post patches for dmesg & systemd
once the kernel patchset lands in a "next" tree; other tools will have to be
patched as we find them.

The second issue is a sysfs stability and output issue that I have a question
on.  Since I'm changing the value of print.time from a bool to an int, the
output of /sys/modules/printk/parameters/time would change from Y/N to 0-3.  The
file is not listed in Documentation/ABI/stable so I think I can change it.  Can
you confirm that this is the case?  I wary of changing anything under sysfs and
I'm not sure who else would know if I can change the output of that file.

If it is the case that the output can be changed, then I'm going to suggest that
we allow, for example, human-readable format "printk.time=monotonic" along with
"printk.time=2" as kernel parameters.  I would also like your thoughts on that idea.

If the file cannot be changed I will have to add an additional module parameter
to printk.  Does "timestamp" sound okay to you?  I will go with whatever you
suggest.

Thanks,

P.
