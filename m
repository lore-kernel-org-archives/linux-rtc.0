That's a horrible idea, really. And there is no point at all.

It calls getnstimeofday(), which is wrong to begin with as we switch
everything in kernel to the 64bit variants.

This is even more wrong as rtc_time64_to_tm is for 64 bit wide second
values....

Why on earth do you need to print that information in RTC format? What's
wrong with just doing:

      pr_info("My so important log message %lld\n", ktime_get_real_seconds());

and then decoding the seconds in post processing? That's completely
sufficient as you intend that for logging. Correlation with user space
CLOCK_REALTIME is even simpler as this is the same as reading it from user
space.

If your main intention is logging/debugging, then you can just use
tracepoints. The tracer allows correlation to user space tracing already.

So unless you can come up with a reasonable explanation why all this voodoo
is required, this is going nowhere.
