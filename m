Agreed and Thanks. In another response, this function has more in common 
with a pr_info_show_time() than I previously have accepted. Most of the 
rtc part goes away if I follow that thread/idea Leaving the following:

Yes, since we put that part into a separate patch, that can be 
punted/accepted on its own, using rtc-lib is a simple concept. The 
commit message for that patch should have had your line of sentiment in 
it! (even (ab)using message :-) )
