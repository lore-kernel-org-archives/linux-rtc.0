I do not have an answer to that.

Are you proposing to disable the RTC while reading the registers, or
something related to my choice of _relaxed? (it follows an explanation
by Marc Zyngier on the irq mux series) Inconsistencies might not be
limited to the date.

BTW is there any more efficient way to get from year+days to
day/month/year without going via seconds?

Thanks for spotting this. The story is that the old downstream has code
for this case, but in my testing I didn't run into that path and forgot.
Explanations are largely missing in the vendor code. That code should
probably be added here in v2 and the dev_info() dropped, rather than
dropping the current no-op expression.

I did test the probe path to work, but I can change it again. The
downstream code had it in probe, but looking at rtc_class_ops I saw
those hooks and thought they'd serve a purpose - what are they for then?
(Any chance you can improve the documentation comments to avoid such
misunderstandings? :))
