Please don't. I only ask for a sentence in the commit message.

No, the kernel has been using only pxa-rtc. The sa1100-rtc is not used, and yet
it accounts the passed time in it.

On platforms where all the OSes use only 1 RTC, the bootloader only touches one
RTC, that's correct. Or said differently : the bootloader touches the union of
all the RTCs the OSes it launches do touch.
