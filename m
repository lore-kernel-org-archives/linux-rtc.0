Hi Rob,

Yes, we want to describe that power key is index 0 and is a wakeup
source, homekey is index 1 and not a wakeup source.

Since power key and homekey are two real HW keys, customer can decide
which key to be the wakeup source or both due to their hw design, so we
put this in DT and can be different for different boards.

Thank you.

Chen
