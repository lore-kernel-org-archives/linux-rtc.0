+Description:
+		The ioctl interface to drivers for real-time clocks (RTCs).
+		Following actions are supported:
+
+		* RTC_RD_TIME, RTC_SET_TIME: Read or set the RTC time. Time
+		  format is a Gregorian calendar date and 24 hour wall clock
+		  time.
+
+		* RTC_AIE_ON, RTC_AIE_OFF: Enable or disable the alarm interrupt
+		  for RTCs that support alarms
+
+		* RTC_ALM_READ, RTC_ALM_SET: Read or set the alarm time for
+		  RTCs that support alarms. Can be set upto 24 hours in the
+		  future. Requires a separate RTC_AIE_ON call to enable the
+		  alarm interrupt. (Prefer to use RTC_WKALM_*)
+
+		* RTC_WKALM_RD, RTC_WKALM_SET: For RTCs that support a more
+		  powerful interface, which can issue alarms beyond 24 hours and
+		  enable IRQs in the same request.
+
+		* RTC_PIE_ON, RTC_PIE_OFF: Enable or disable the periodic
+		  interrupt for RTCs that support periodic interrupts.
+
+		* RTC_UIE_ON, RTC_UIE_OFF: Enable or disable the update
+		  interrupt for RTCs that support it.
+
+		* RTC_IRQP_READ, RTC_IRQP_SET: Read or set the frequency for
+		  periodic interrupts for RTCs that support periodic interrupts.
+		  Requires a separate RTC_PIE_ON call to enable the periodic
+		  interrupts.
+
+		The ioctl() calls supported by the older /dev/rtc interface are
+		also supported by the newer RTC class framework. However,
+		because the chips and systems are not standardized, some PC/AT
+		functionality might not be provided. And in the same way, some
+		newer features -- including those enabled by ACPI -- are exposed
+		by the RTC class framework, but can't be supported by the older
+		driver.

-IOCTL interface
----------------
-
-The ioctl() calls supported by /dev/rtc are also supported by the RTC class
-framework.  However, because the chips and systems are not standardized,
-some PC/AT functionality might not be provided.  And in the same way, some
-newer features -- including those enabled by ACPI -- are exposed by the
-RTC class framework, but can't be supported by the older driver.
-
-    *	RTC_RD_TIME, RTC_SET_TIME ... every RTC supports at least reading
-	time, returning the result as a Gregorian calendar date and 24 hour
-	wall clock time.  To be most useful, this time may also be updated.
-
-    *	RTC_AIE_ON, RTC_AIE_OFF, RTC_ALM_SET, RTC_ALM_READ ... when the RTC
-	is connected to an IRQ line, it can often issue an alarm IRQ up to
-	24 hours in the future.  (Use RTC_WKALM_* by preference.)
-
-    *	RTC_WKALM_SET, RTC_WKALM_RD ... RTCs that can issue alarms beyond
-	the next 24 hours use a slightly more powerful API, which supports
-	setting the longer alarm time and enabling its IRQ using a single
-	request (using the same model as EFI firmware).
-
-    *	RTC_UIE_ON, RTC_UIE_OFF ... if the RTC offers IRQs, the RTC framework
-	will emulate this mechanism.
-
-    *	RTC_PIE_ON, RTC_PIE_OFF, RTC_IRQP_SET, RTC_IRQP_READ ... these icotls
-	are emulated via a kernel hrtimer.
-
-In many cases, the RTC alarm can be a system wake event, used to force
-Linux out of a low power sleep state (or hibernation) back to a fully
-operational state.  For example, a system could enter a deep power saving
-state until it's time to execute some scheduled tasks.
-
-Note that many of these ioctls are handled by the common rtc-dev interface.
-Some common examples:
-
-    *	RTC_RD_TIME, RTC_SET_TIME: the read_time/set_time functions will be
-	called with appropriate values.
-
-    *	RTC_ALM_SET, RTC_ALM_READ, RTC_WKALM_SET, RTC_WKALM_RD: gets or sets
-	the alarm rtc_timer. May call the set_alarm driver function.
-
-    *	RTC_IRQP_SET, RTC_IRQP_READ: These are emulated by the generic code.
-
-    *	RTC_PIE_ON, RTC_PIE_OFF: These are also emulated by the generic code.
