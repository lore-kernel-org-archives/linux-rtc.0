Hi,

Well, I had that patch:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/abelloni/linux.git/commit/?h=rtc-ranges&id=79729c30854986faf4d26b0303dba220f4ef89de
part of a series I didn't send yet (it is still WIP and I just pushed
it).

Can you rebase on top of that? The RO/RW annotation would be a nice
addition.

Please, move the ioctl documentation to its own file,
Documentation/ABI/stable/rtc-cdev

The [0-*] range is not correct, it should be [0-9]+

This must be the RTC mailing list.

Out of context, this paragraph is weird.

The reference to this test should probably stay in rtc.txt
