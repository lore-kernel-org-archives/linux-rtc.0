The hardware stores a 15-bit number of days since Jan 1st of that base
year. It does not store the base year.

The datasheet does not name such a base year. No manual is available.

The driver needs to get it from somewhere for calculating day/month/year
in read_time and days in set_time.

The read_offset/set_offset API appeared to be something different.

These are TV boxes, so yes, I'm dual-booting into Android with a vendor
4.1 kernel and would like to keep date compatibility.

As stated in the v2 rtc commit message, 2014 is the base year
encountered on all three devices that I've had access to.
@Jiang, if you're using a different base year, please speak up!

That's what I've attempted here - but for RDA8810PL serial Rob said he
did not want future changes to my binding, therefore I am asking for his
confirmation here.

Regards,
Andreas
