really thanks! it's an optional solution I thought it 's fine and worth
doing

but so far I cannot fully make sure of whether mfd can accept two
devices holding overlay IORESOURCE_MEM.

Or do you like Rob's suggestion in [1] ? By which, I tend to embed a
sub-device with platform_device_register_data api in the rtc probe()
instead of treating it as a dt node under rtc node, but which seems
something a bit violates your preferences :(

Just confirm to know which way I should step into before I produce next
version.
