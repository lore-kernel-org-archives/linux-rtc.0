Sure.

I will separate this into a new patch and add it at a later date. It is a recommendation
to have this in for both DA9062/3 now, although I have not seen this happen during
my testing -- it should be added.
Something similar happened with the RTC previously -- everything tested fine 
with earlier kernels until the RTC core functions were improved and I picked up a
synchronisation problem with my testing:

I will re-order the patches accordingly.

I can add this to a different patch and change it at a later date.
It is to fix a minor wording problem with the GPL header so it matches the correct
MODULE_LICENSE(""); macro. 

https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/4/18/19

The info at the top of the file needs to remove the LGPL worded text where appropriate:
words such as "Library" from the line "GNU Library General Public License"; and replace
the word "library" with "program" in several places

Yes, I will change this.

I can check for a binary comparison against the address of the 
static const struct of_device_id da9063_compatible_reg_id_table[] = {}
entry for DA9063.

The DA9063 driver already associates "dlg,da9063-rtc" with both BB and AD
register maps. I think that altering the string at this point would break backwards
compatibility in the device tree for the DA9063.

The DA9063 core dynamically checks for the chip variant at run-time and then saves
it in the "variant_code". This comes from the original submission of the driver.
Distinguishing DT compatible strings was suggested, but the method conflicted with the
automatic variant detection of the DA9063 chip, and so it was decided against.
