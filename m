I don't think it is really an issue to have setting the RTC time take a
few seconds.

Yes and I would hope userspace knows that it is using NTP to sync the
local clock...

Aren't those mainly userspace/integration problems that should be fixed

Ok, that is a good point to keep hctosys.

What I see is that people that care about precisely setting the RTC are
not using systohc because of the 0.5s offset issue or because it doesn't
do what they want and instead are using their own userspace tool to set
the RTC time.

They have the right to keep those tools closed if they desire so.

The necessary ABI for userspace to do the right thing is already there
and you are going to add a new one.

Also, fixing systohc will not fix the offset for people using hwclock or
any other tools (e.g. systemd).

I pretty much prefer trying to fix existing userspace tools or if this
is not possible have a new tool to handle reading/setting the RTC time.
