There is another option to remedy this and the dmesg tooling issues:

Instead of switching the time stamps in dmesg to a different clock we might
as well have an optional secondary timestamp. So instead of:

 [  341.590930] wlan0: associated

you would get:

 [  341.590930] [ sec.usec] wlan0: associated

where the second time stamp would be CLOCK_REALTIME/BOOTTIME.

That should also solve Prarits problem, hmm?
